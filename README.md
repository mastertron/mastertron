## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I'm a recent **M.Sc. Electronics** graduate from Mar Augusthinose College, Ramapuram, with a strong foundation in electronics and embedded systems. My passion lies in developing innovative solutions by merging hardware and software to solve real-world problems. I am actively seeking a position in a dynamic organization where I can leverage my skills in embedded systems, IoT, and web development to make a meaningful impact.

## 💼 Experience

### 🌟 Internship in Electronics Hardware Design  
**Silicor Innovations | Kottayam**  
*Feb 2022 - Apr 2022*  
During my internship, I acquired foundational skills in PCB design using Eagle software and developed a prototype board for the **ATMEGA 808 microcontroller** for the **IoT Landslide Warning System** project. This experience solidified my understanding of hardware design and embedded systems.

### 🌐 Web Development (Self-Learned)  
I have self-learned skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js using the Visual Studio Code editor. I have built various sample projects, including a personal website, and continue to explore modern web development practices.

## 🛠 Projects

### 📡 Disaster Alerting and Management System (DAMS)  
*Mar Augusthinose College, Ramapuram | Feb 2024 - Jun 2024*  
This sensor-based project utilizes a network of sensors to monitor environmental conditions in real-time across vulnerable regions. It serves as an early warning system for disaster management by detecting anomalies and triggering alerts. The project uses the **ESP32 MCU** as the main control unit and integrates data handling with **Firebase** using the **MQTT protocol**. Communication protocols like **I2C, SPI, UART, and WebSocket** were implemented.

### 🌍 IoT Landslide Warning System  
*Mar Augusthinose College, Ramapuram | Mar 2022 - Jun 2022*  
This project focuses on early detection of landslides using an IoT-based system. The transmitter section collects data on landslide occurrences and sends it to the receiver section, where data is analyzed using the **ATMEGA 808 MCU** and then uploaded to the IoT cloud via the **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module** using the **Blynk IoT Dashboard**. Key communication protocols used include **I2C, SPI, and UART**.

### 🔧 ESP8266/ESP32 MCU Control with React & Firebase  
*Mar Augusthinose College, Ramapuram*  
Developed a real-time MCU control system using a web interface coded in **JavaScript** and powered by **React** and **Firebase**. The website allows users to interact with and control the MCU in real-time, enhancing system responsiveness and functionality.
